#### Employment

##### Senior DevOps Engineer, Refinery29 — New York, NY & Los Angeles, CA 4/2015 - 11/2019

- Spearheaded an effort implementing OpenStack to replace an aging Eucalyptus cluster. Along with the cluster, I built systems to dynamically build development and staging environments using a slackbot for easy user access and an OAuth implementation for Nginx restricting access to members of our GitHub organization.
- Containerized a server side rendered React application and an Nginx routing system using Docker and deployed to AWS EKS using Terraform. The system also takes advantage of SpotInst to minimize costs and is managed by Jenkins which is also running in the Kubernetes cluster.
- As part of a larger migration of our CMS from a custom PHP application to Wordpress, I built a system utilizing AWS Lambda and SQS, which populates our route store in redis.
- In order to increase our develivery speeds and ease the amount of development necessary for CDN configuration changes, I consolidated our CDN usage to Fastly.
- To reign in a complex system which utilized nearly half a dozen disparate systems, most of which were terribly outdated, I replaced our monitoring, metric collection/visualization, and alerting systems with Datadog.
- Provided operations support for the team which build Refinery29's "Money Diaries" user submission system including integration of Rabbitmq into the Refinery29 infrastructure.
- Following adoption of Ansible, I reimplemented an aging, local development system using Vagrant. This included an extensive ruby plugin which eased developer effort to update the environment.
- Converted a legacy puppet system to Ansible.

##### Software Engineer, Elephant Ventures — New York, NY, 3/2013 – 4/2015

These playbooks were used with a custom built system to deploy a management application for the medical device to AWS, VMware, or a Vagrant development environment.
- Worked on varied teams with between 0 and 6 other developers to build or update websites and web apps for clients, many of which ran on Drupal, but others ran on the Vanilla PHP framework, Experia, and a custom Flask/Node.js/iOS stack. We also used the Angular Javascript framework extensively.
